## BattleShips - Online 

This Project is a Submission for PP3 with Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Development. This Project is based on Project Idea 2 from the Assessment Handbook, which is to create an interactive BattleShip Game for Users.

This version of the project allows users to place their ships in a variety of locations with both Horizontal and Vertical orientations, represented by H and V respectively in game.

## Features

The game features a robust User Input system that aims to prevent and InputErrors that may occur during gameplay. This has been achieved through a combination of try/except loops and forcing all user input into the same case to cut down on the length of input validation required.
